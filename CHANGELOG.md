### Breaking Changes
None (initial release).

### Known Issues
1. **Windows**: Building ONNX Runtime requires Visual C++ Build Tools. Workaround: Use WSL2 or Docker.
2. **Alpine Linux**: glibc incompatibility with Node.js prebuilt binaries. Workaround: Use Docker image or Node.js binary from Alpine repository.
3. **Serverless (Vercel, AWS Lambda)**: Cold start latency 3-5s due to large ONNX runtime artifacts. Mitigation: Use HTTP caching or warm up with periodic requests.
4. **Large Models**: Models >50 MB may exceed memory limits in serverless. Mitigation: Quantize ONNX model or split into multiple smaller models.

### Compatibility Matrix

| Component | Support Level | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Node.js 18.x | ✅ TESTED | Primary target |
| Node.js 20.x | ✅ TESTED | Recommended for new projects |
| Node.js 22.x | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Works but not officially tested |
| Node.js <18 | ❌ UNSUPPORTED | Requires upgrade |
| macOS (Intel) | ✅ TESTED | Full support |
| macOS (ARM/M1+) | ✅ TESTED | Full support |
| Ubuntu 20.04+ | ✅ TESTED | Full support |
| Windows 10/11 | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Use WSL2 or Docker |
| Alpine Linux | ❌ UNSUPPORTED | Use Docker image |
| PostgreSQL | ✅ TESTED | Production grade |
| MySQL | ⚠️ WORKS | Supported but not extensively tested |
| SQLite | ⚠️ WORKS | Development only |
| Vercel | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Cold start latency ~3-5s |
| AWS Lambda | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Time/memory constraints |
| Railway | ✅ WORKS | Full support |
| Cloudflare | ❌ UNSUPPORTED | No native binary support |

### Performance Benchmarks

- **ONNX Inference** (Linux, Node 20): <10ms for typical models
- **Feature Extraction**: 50-200ms depending on database queries (network dependent)
- **Model Training** (Docker): 30-120s for 10K-100K records (algorithm & data dependent)
- **Cold Start** (Vercel): 3-5 seconds
- **Batch Predictions** (100 records): 50-500ms depending on batch size

### Migration Path
If upgrading from experimental/beta versions:
1. Backup existing ONNX model files
2. Regenerate models using v1.0.0 trainer
3. Update `defineModel()` calls if using previous alpha syntax (unlikely for v1.0)
4. Run full test suite before deploying to production
